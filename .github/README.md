# CI/CD Workflows for Azure App Service Architecture

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for automated infrastructure management, security scanning, cost optimization, and backup operations.

## üöÄ Available Workflows

### 1. Terraform Plan (`terraform-plan.yml`)
**Trigger**: Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
**Purpose**: Validates Terraform configuration and shows planned changes

**Features**:
- Terraform format checking
- Configuration validation
- Plan generation with detailed output
- PR comments with plan results
- Artifact upload for plan files

### 2. Terraform Apply (`terraform-apply.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Deploys infrastructure changes to Azure

**Features**:
- Environment-specific deployments
- Manual approval for production
- Deployment status updates
- Output collection and reporting
- State file backup

### 3. Terraform Destroy (`terraform-destroy.yml`)
**Trigger**: Manual dispatch only
**Purpose**: Safely destroys infrastructure resources

**Features**:
- Confirmation requirement (type "DESTROY")
- Environment-specific destruction
- Safety checks and validation
- Cleanup of related artifacts

### 4. Security Scan (`security-scan.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push/PR to main branches, weekly schedule
**Purpose**: Scans infrastructure code for security vulnerabilities

**Tools Used**:
- **TFSec**: Terraform-specific security scanner
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security analysis
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability and misconfiguration scanner

### 5. Cost Optimization (`cost-optimization.yml`)
**Trigger**: Weekly schedule, manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Analyzes costs and provides optimization recommendations

**Features**:
- Resource cost analysis
- Utilization metrics
- Optimization recommendations
- Automated issue creation
- Cost trend analysis

### 6. Backup and Recovery (`backup.yml`)
**Trigger**: Daily schedule, manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Creates backups of infrastructure and data

**Backup Types**:
- **Full**: Complete infrastructure backup
- **Incremental**: Changes since last backup
- **Configuration**: Terraform state and configs only

## üîß Setup Requirements

### GitHub Secrets
Configure the following secrets in your repository:

```bash
# Azure Authentication
AZURE_CREDENTIALS='{"clientId":"...","clientSecret":"...","subscriptionId":"...","tenantId":"..."}'

# Terraform Variables
TF_VAR_PROJECT_NAME="azure-app-arch"
TF_VAR_ENVIRONMENT="production"

# Database Access
SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-sql-admin-password"
```

### Environment Protection Rules
Set up environment protection rules in GitHub:

1. **Production Environment**:
   - Required reviewers
   - Wait timer (optional)
   - Restrict to main branch

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Required reviewers (optional)
   - Restrict to develop branch

3. **Development Environment**:
   - No restrictions (for testing)

## üìã Usage Examples

### Deploy to Production
```bash
# Via GitHub UI
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Terraform Apply"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "production" environment
5. Click "Run workflow"

# Via CLI (if you have GitHub CLI)
gh workflow run terraform-apply.yml -f environment=production
```

### Destroy Development Environment
```bash
# Via GitHub UI
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Terraform Destroy"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "development" environment
5. Type "DESTROY" in confirmation field
6. Click "Run workflow"
```

### Manual Backup
```bash
# Via GitHub UI
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Backup and Recovery"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select backup type (full/incremental/configuration)
5. Click "Run workflow"
```

## üîí Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning
- **TFSec**: Scans for Terraform security issues
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure security analysis
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning
- **SARIF Integration**: Results appear in GitHub Security tab

### Access Control
- Environment-specific permissions
- Manual approval for production
- Confirmation requirements for destructive operations
- Audit trail for all operations

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Automated Cost Analysis
- Weekly cost reports
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Optimization recommendations
- Budget alerts and notifications

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. Use Basic App Service plans for development
2. Implement auto-scaling policies
3. Set up resource tagging
4. Monitor unused resources
5. Use reserved instances for predictable workloads

## üîÑ Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Daily**: Automated backups
- **Retention**: 30 days for artifacts, 7 days for local backups
- **Types**: Full, incremental, and configuration-only backups

### Recovery Process
1. Download backup artifacts from GitHub Actions
2. Restore Terraform state
3. Import existing resources if needed
4. Restore database from .bacpac files
5. Verify service functionality

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Workflow Monitoring
- Success/failure notifications
- Deployment status updates
- Cost optimization alerts
- Security scan results

### Integration Points
- Azure Monitor for infrastructure metrics
- Application Insights for application monitoring
- Log Analytics for centralized logging
- GitHub notifications for workflow status

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify Azure credentials in secrets
   - Check subscription permissions
   - Ensure service principal has required roles

2. **Terraform State Issues**
   - Verify state file permissions
   - Check for state locks
   - Ensure consistent state across environments

3. **Resource Conflicts**
   - Check for naming conflicts
   - Verify resource group permissions
   - Ensure proper resource dependencies

### Getting Help
- Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
- Review Terraform plan outputs
- Consult Azure documentation
- Check security scan results in Security tab

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Always review plans** before applying changes
2. **Use environment protection rules** for production
3. **Monitor costs regularly** and optimize resources
4. **Keep backups current** and test recovery procedures
5. **Review security scans** and address findings promptly
6. **Use descriptive commit messages** for better tracking
7. **Tag resources appropriately** for cost tracking
